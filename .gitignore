# GITIGNORE – KELVIN STARDATE CONVERTER
# ======================================
# This repository converts Earth dates to stardates and back again.
# It does not need:
#   – temporal paradoxes
#   – mirror-universe artifacts
#   – or whatever Future Me swears was “fine locally”
#
# This is a public repo maintained by one person
# who has seen too many timelines go wrong.
#
# Assume:
#   - generated files are lying to you
#   - local state is not canon
#   - Git remembers forever
#
# Temporal Prime Directive applies.
# — Kylie

# ===========================
# 🧹 General System Junk
# ===========================
.DS_Store            # macOS leaves these everywhere, like tribbles
Thumbs.db            # Windows thumbnail cache — non-canon
desktop.ini          # also Windows, also unnecessary
*.bak                # “just in case” files from a doomed timeline
*.tmp                # temporary means temporary
*.swp                # Vim swap files — I am not rescuing your crashed session

# ===========================
# 🐍 Python Bytecode & Runtime Debris
# ===========================
__pycache__/         # Python’s memory echoes
*.py[codz]           # compiled bytecode — discarded between timelines
*.pyo
*.pyd
*.pyc
*$py.class

# ===========================
# 🧪 Virtual Environments (DO NOT COMMIT)
# ===========================
venv/                # the classic holodeck illusion
.venv/               # sleeker, still fake
env/                 # someone always names it this
ENV/                 # capitalization does not make it canon

# If a venv is committed, a temporal incursion has occurred.

# ===========================
# 🧱 Build, Packaging, & Distribution Artifacts
# ===========================
build/               # construction debris
dist/                # things meant to be shipped elsewhere
*.egg-info/          # Python packaging metadata (regenerated by pip)
.eggs/
#/.vscode/

# This is a source repository, not a cargo bay.

# ===========================
# 💻 IDEs, Editors, & Config Anomalies
# ===========================
# your VS Code setup is not Starfleet standard 
/.vscode/            
.idea/               # JetBrains has Opinions™
*.iml                # IntelliJ module files
*.code-workspace     # VS Code session state — non-transferable
.project             # Eclipse persists somehow
.classpath           # Eclipse again
.settings/           # Eclipse, inexplicably
*.suo                # Visual Studio user settings
*.user               # more per-user config leakage
*.workspace          # generic IDE noise

# ===========================
# 🔐 Local & Machine-Specific Secrets
# ===========================
.gitconfig           # global Git settings do not belong in the timeline
.gitignore_global    # personal ignore files stay personal
.ssh/                # no keys, no host files, no Section 31 nonsense
*.pem                # certificates do not belong in Git
*.key
*.crt
# ===========================
# 📜 Logs & Transcripts (Local Only)
# ===========================
/logs/
*.log                # logs are for diagnostics, not archival
!logs/.gitkeep       # but the folder exists on purpose

# ===========================
# 🚫 Executables & Compiled Binaries
# ===========================
*.exe                # if it runs natively, it lives elsewhere
*.dll                # dynamic link libraries — hard no
*.so                 # shared objects — also no
*.out                # compiled outputs
*.o                  # object files
*.bin                # generic binaries
*.msi                # installers have no business here

# This project is Python.
# If it smells like C, someone violated the Prime Directive

# ===========================
# 🗜️ Archives & Compressed Files
# ===========================
*.zip
*.7z
*.rar
*.tar
*.gz

# Compressed timelines are unstable. Do not commit.

# ===========================
# 🧪 Testing, Coverage, & Tool Exhaust
# ===========================
.coverage            # coverage data
htmlcov/             # coverage reports
.pytest_cache/       # pytest detritus
.mypy_cache/         # type checker residue
.tox/                # parallel universes we do not track

# ===========================
# ⚔️ Merge Conflict Fallout
# ===========================
*.orig
*.rej

# If these appear, history has forked badly

# ===========================
# 📝 Explicit Allowances
# ===========================
# Python source files (*.py) are, shockingly, allowed.
# CLI entrypoints and modules belong here.
#
# requirements.txt is tracked.
# README.md is tracked.
# SETUP_FOR_DUMMIES.md is tracked.
# This .gitignore is tracked because documentation matters.
#
# If Future Me adds another language:
# congratulations, we are rewriting spacetime (and this file)
